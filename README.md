### Abstract
The objective of this project is to develop a personal budgeting and expense analysis application that empowers users to effectively manage their finances. By enabling users to track their expenses, visualize spending patterns, and gain insights for informed financial decisions, the application aims to enhance users' understanding of their financial habits. Leveraging data visualization tools like Seaborn and Matplotlib, alongside machine learning algorithms such as K-Means clustering and K-Nearest Neighbors classification, the app will provide personalized budget recommendations and facilitate proactive financial management.

### Goal
The goal of this project is to develop an intelligent budgeting and expense management app that leverages machine learning algorithms to empower users to make informed financial decisions and cultivate healthy spending habits. By integrating machine learning techniques such as clustering, classification, and predictive modeling, the app will provide personalized insights, automate expense categorization, predict spending patterns, and deliver actionable recommendations for budgeting and saving.

### Objectives
##### Phase 1 - Data Visualization:
- Visualize expenses using Seaborn and Matplotlib libraries
- Create various visualizations such as bar charts, pie charts, line graphs, and heatmaps to highlight spending pattern
##### Phase 2 - K-Means Clustering:
- Implement K-Means clustering to segment users into distinct groups based on their spending habits
- Analyze each cluster to identify characteristics of different spending behaviors
##### Phase 3 - KNN for Prediction:
- Apply K-Nearest Neighbors to predict future expenses based on similar user profiles
- Train the KNN model using spending data to enhance prediction accuracy
##### Phase 4 - Web Application/ GUI Development:
- Create a user-friendly application/ GUI using Tkinter
- Allow users to input their expenses, visualize their data, and receive personalized insights based on clustering and prediction models
